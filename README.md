# Transcriptomic_dynamics
Determination of DEGs from microarray and RNA-seq to study sex differentiation between stages by sex between two developmental stages to further understand transcriptomic dynamics during sex differentiaiton across different vertebrate species. The code includes the analysis of data from microarray using limma and RNA seq using DESeq2, as well as the code to produce the plot allowing visualization of four fold change data points as a single data point with the corresponding color code: blue for Male Enriched Genes, red for Female Enriched Genes and grey for genes that similarly change expression in both sexes. Plot adapted from Munger et al., 2013.
